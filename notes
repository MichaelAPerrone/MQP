use virtualenv to run the clawpack code:

activate virtual environment with
. ven/bin/activate
install dependencies for the project with
pip install -r requirements.txt
deactivate virtual environment with
deactivate

To create a virtual environment use
virtualenv name
after installing virtualenv with pip
Check the man page for how to specify which python version to install
Clawpack 5.4 runs on python 2.7.12 but might not be compatible with other pytho versions, so if 2.7.12 is not the default python on your system you will want to specify.
